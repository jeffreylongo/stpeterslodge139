Worshipful Coleman and his Wife Mary Ellen also built, owned, and ran the Paxton House Hotel which at the time was one of the largest hotels in the area boasting 32 rooms for guests and stayed open year round. The Paxton House Hotel was a block away from the Detroit Hotel on Central Ave and 1st Street. The location is now an empty lot as seen in the pictures attached. Through Worshipful Coleman’s guidance Lodge 139 was able to forge through the early years and last the test of time. Worshipful Coleman passed to the Celestial Lodge Above in 1909 and is interred at the historic Greenwood Cemetery which is located on 9th street and 11th Ave S. like most of the other early pioneers of St. Petersburg.

More than 200 ships were sunk, including Captain Miner’s.  He and his crew of 19 men spent the next 18 days in open boats before they were rescued.  After recuperating, he became Master on one of the Plant system boats. It was in this capacity that he became a blockade runner to Cuba, during the Spanish-American war.  After several successful trips, he finally fell victim to yellow fever while in Cuba.  He would have died if not for Theodore Roosevelt and other officers, all fellow Masons, pulling him through on a diet of brandy and morphine.
